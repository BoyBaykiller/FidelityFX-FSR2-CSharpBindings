# FidelityFX-FSR2-CSharpBindings

An attempt to make C# bindings for FSR2 with an OpenGL backend.

You may know that the official [AMD FidelityFX FSR2](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR2) library does not actually come with an OpenGL backend. However, [this fork](https://github.com/JuanDiegoMontoya/FidelityFX-FSR2) adds one.
Said fork is used as basis for the bindings.
